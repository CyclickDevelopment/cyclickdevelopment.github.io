Developers can define workflows that automatically trigger these actions whenever code is pushed to a repository, reducing manual intervention and the risk of human error.</p><p>As one of the leating CI Platforms - GitHub Actions supports various languages, build environments, production targets and the various automation steps allow developers a huge degree of flexibility in the way they wish to configure their build processes. </p><p>Let&apos;s take an example from our own experience. We deploy the Ghost Theme used on our own site, and other company&apos;s sites for whom we develop. The Ghost CMS platform provides their own </p><p>The other great thing about the GitHub Actions workflow is it leverages the Configuration-as-Code (CaC) pattern - the benefits of which you can read about <a href="https://octopus.com/blog/config-as-code-what-is-it-how-is-it-beneficial?ref=www.cyclick-development.co.uk">here</a>. </p><h2 id="a-worked-example">A worked example</h2><p>Generally we configure our repositories such that once we push to the <code>master</code>, we are expecting this to get deployed. More complex workflows might deploy to a staging and subsequent production environment with for example <code>stage</code> and <code>production</code> branches. The YAML looks like this:</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">name: Deploy Theme
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: TryGhost/action-deploy-theme@v1
        with:
          api-url: ${{ secrets.GHOST_ADMIN_API_URL }}
          api-key: ${{ secrets.GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY }}</code></pre><p>Pretty simple to read right? We&apos;re telling GitHub to take action on pushes to <code>master</code> or <code>main</code>, and ultimately use the <code>TryGhost/action-deploy-theme@v1</code> to deploy our theme. This goes through the steps of building, packaging and deploying our theme. Of course, this is pretty much the same for anyone who uses a Ghost theme, so it makes total sense for this to be really simple boiler plate. </p><p>Now, you&apos;ll know that GitHub is public and we don&apos;t want to expose our API url or key secrets to the entire internet, so GitHub provides a secure secret vault for that kind of information to be provided to the pipeline as it runs. </p><p>Asthe pipeline runs, we get a wealth of information about the pipeline, which is all updated live:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.cyclick-development.co.uk/content/images/2023/09/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="CI Platforms - GitHub Actions" loading="lazy" width="1309" height="537" srcset="https://www.cyclick-development.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/image.png 600w, https://www.cyclick-development.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/image.png 1000w, https://www.cyclick-development.co.uk/content/images/2023/09/image.png 1309w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This pipeline is rather simple, so it contains just one <code>deploy</code> job. However, more complex jobs show various tasks within this view, and any pipelines with test results also capture that information in this view. </p><p>There is a lot of granularity and complexity around where the agent activities are run (you can choose to run on GitHub&apos;s various agents or self-host an agent on infrastructure of your choice). </p><p>GitHub is heavily focussed on the open source community, and this shows in our example here. With minimal effort we were able to pick up a pipeline from another user (i.e. the official TryGhost repositories) and use it in our pipeline straight away. </p><p>You can read the documentation for GitHub Actions <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart?ref=www.cyclick-development.co.uk">here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cyclick Development | Who We Are]]></title><description><![CDATA[More than just an embedded development contract specialist, Cyclick Development also provides training, mentoring and testing services.]]></description><link>https://www.cyclick-development.co.uk/cyclick-development/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">64ef8a77dee46100012f2440</guid><category><![CDATA[embedded-development]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Pete Washer]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2023 18:29:19 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1587620962725-abab7fe55159?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fGRldmVsb3BlcnxlbnwwfHx8fDE2OTUyMzIyOTB8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="embedded-development">Embedded Development</h2><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1587620962725-abab7fe55159?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fGRldmVsb3BlcnxlbnwwfHx8fDE2OTUyMzIyOTB8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Cyclick Development | Who We Are"><p>At Cyclick we specialize in providing high quality, testable, maintainable and shippable solutions for all your firmware project&apos;s needs, with a particular focus on C++.

Peer reviews might also catch some mistakes. </p><p>But there are various reasons why these are no longer considered best practise:</p><ul><li>How long does it take you to catch a mistake?</li><li>Why would you rely on someone who believes the code works before they even start testing it?</li><li>What if you broke something way in a different part of the codebase?

They allow the automation of many aspects of development including:</p><ul><li>Static code analysis</li><li>Basic peer review checks</li><li>Compilation &amp; runtime checks</li><li>Running of automated test suites </li><li>Blocking code merges based on rules and analysis of the above</li></ul><p>CI pipelines can also be combined with <em>Continuous Deployment</em> (CD) pipelines to setup development, test/integration environments and even &apos;push to production&apos; style environments where live customer-facing environments are deployed for immedate use. The benefit of this is that usually such pipelines have various intricate working parts, or need security authorisation, or just have so many steps that automating the deployment of applications makes perfect sense - humans are just <a href="https://thefutureofthings.com/14319-removing-human-error-with-automation/?ref=www.cyclick-development.co.uk">prone to mistakes</a>, especially when it comes to repetetive tasks. </p><p>At Cyclick Development we are running a <a href="https://www.cyclick-development.co.uk/tag/continuous-integration/">series of posts</a> dedicated to showing some of the tools available and contrasting them with one another.

An 8-bit, 2MHz home computer platform which was also widely used in educational settings, the BBC Micro was a hugely successful peice of equipment - sales of over 1.5 million are reported. </p><p>Despite the BBC Micro platform itself being discontinued in 1994, stable releases of the BBC Micro language are <a href="https://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcbasic.html?ref=www.cyclick-development.co.uk">still being created</a>. You can read the Raspberry Pi article above which takes you through a basic helicopter game tutorial - but how about we start with something more simple?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="the-basics">The BASICs...</h2>
<pre><code class="language-bbcbasic">10 CLS
20 PRINT &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;
30 GOTO 10 
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>So what&apos;s going on here? If you&apos;ve programmed in a modern language (anything after say... 1994), you might notice some oddities. For starters, you have to put the line numbers in yourself. And the code executes in the order of your line numbers!</p><p>The above code could be typed in this order, and work exactly the same:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>20 PRINT &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;

<p>Try the <code>LIST</code> command to see the whole program in the order of execution.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If you&apos;ve been following so far you will notice we&apos;ve incremented in lumps of 10 lines - that&apos;s intentional and advised practise. If you&apos;ve missed something out... the only way to put something in the gap is to insert it with an integer line number. So we can add:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-bbcbasic">10 CLS
11 PRINT &quot;HELLO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN&quot;
20 PRINT &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;
30 GOTO 10
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The other amusing factor here of course, is by having line 30 as <code>GOTO 10</code>, we&apos;ve ensured the computer will run our little program for ever and ever, until the computer is reset. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whats-actually-going-on">What&apos;s actually going on?</h2>
<p>Underneath the somewhat unforgiving user interface (which just prints &quot;Mistake!&quot; if you get something wrong), BBC BASIC is an interpreted language. This converts the typed text into machine code for execution. A somewhat unique feature of the BBC BASIC language was its ability to interpret and compile assembler code within an application. In various cases this allowed BBC BASIC to execute faster than Microsoft BASIC at the time.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>You can&apos;t mention BBC Basic without mentioning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Wilson?ref=www.cyclick-development.co.uk">Sophie Wilson</a> - key to the design of the BBC Micro and BBC Basic, Wilson also played a critical role in the design of the ARM architecture.

Python is often described as &apos;batteries included&apos; - the language and interpreter does a lot of the work for you to build the working environment needed to run. </p><p>So...</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Hello world&quot;)</code></pre><p>It&apos;s really that simple! But what if we wanted to do something a bit more snazzy, add some colours perhaps? We&apos;ll get to see a few more features of the language that way:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-python">import colorama
from colorama import Fore

print(Fore.RED + &quot;Hello world!&quot;)</code></pre><figcaption>This one might not work in PowerShell or Windows CMD... Try linux :)</figcaption></figure><p>Here we start to see the powerful tools which come as part of Python, and from the vast community of developers who create modules for Python. Using the <code>pip</code> package we can <code>pip install colorama</code>, which will allow us to use the module in scripts going forward. The line above <code>import colorama</code> brings in the module to our script, and <code>from colorama import Fore</code> pulls the module&apos;s <code>Fore</code> class in a way that allows us to use Fore directly. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World - C]]></title><description><![CDATA[C was the first language we worked with at University.

<p><strong>C</strong> (pronounced /&#x2C8;si&#x2D0;/ &#x2013; like the letter c)[6] is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C&apos;s features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers and protocol stacks. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.</p>
